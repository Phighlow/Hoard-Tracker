This is a fairly simple application but could absolutely use refinement

TO USE
Start by adding a monster to the list by clicking "Add Creature"
You will be prompted for a Name, Amount, Size, and HP per creature

To effect this creature with a spell or force a save click "Make a Save"
Input the spell details and the all the math should math! Pretty simple really
